# Tank_Game
CSE 120 Intro to Python course final project (2D GUI Game). Approximate timeline: 2-3 months. This is a 2D side view tank game built in the processing development environment.
To run this project you need processing 3.5.4
Note that you must open an empty processing file to download the python mode extentsion. The language modes can be found in the top right corner of the processing DE.
After the python mode has been installed, ensure that the project folder you have downloaded has the same name as one of the .pyde files. 
In this case it is "CSE120TankGame". So rename the project folder to this. Ensure the other font files are within the same folder after unzipping as well.
